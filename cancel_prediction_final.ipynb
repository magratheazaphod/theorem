    "# Loan Cancellation #\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "I focused on building a parsimonious model by first reducing the number of variables to a workable representative set, and then understanding the effect of each variable on the probability of loan cancellation, and discarding variables with limited predictivity. My final model uses whether the loanee has taken out a Prosper loan before, the size of loan requested and the loan's interest rate, as well as loanee's monthly debt, monthly income, employment status, credit card use and number of real estate trades, and the number of loan inquiries initialized as predictors. My final model achieves an AUC score of xxx.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensional Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the large number of columns in the data (86 to start), my initial focus was dimensional reduction: Finding a smaller set of variables that still encompasses most of the original information. One way to do this would be Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by rotation of eigenvectors, but since I was dealing with an unfamiliar data set, I preferred to use a different method to allow me to pare down data more deliberately. Instead, I used Pearson's r to find variables that were highly correlated, which I then turned into a graph with networkx to find connected families. After doing this, I chose one representive variable from each family and dropped the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first application of this graph technique with r = .55 found twelve families and reduced the number of variables from 80 to 56. I chose an r such that the max family size would be no larger than 10. I then reapplied the same method with a lower cutoff of r = .45. This method proved to be imperfect - in the original run-through, I ended up discarding NumPriorProsperLoans, which I later realized to be highly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression with Individual Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "I then performed a logistic regression with each individual variable to see whether a significant relation exists, and then I started to build my final logistic model one variable at a time. In the case of clearly related families of variables, such as the combination of DolMonthlyDebt-DolMonthlyIncome-FracDebtToIncomeRatio, I investigated the set of variables as a group to see what combination of variables provided better predictivity (in this case, DolMonthlyDebt and DolMonthlyIncome performed best). Plugging in each variable at a time proved painstaking, but given my unfamiliarity with loan data I didn't feel comfortable with making assumptions about which variables might be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I used the numerical variables, and the categorical variable StrEmploymentStatus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "* The single best predictor of loan cancellation is simply familiarity with the Prosper platform. Users who have taken out a Prosper loan before have only a 13% chance of cancellation, versus 36% if they have not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Potential loanees who list their employment status as \"Other\" are much more likely to cancel than ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* One might expect the interest rate of the loan to strongly influence cancellations, but in fact interest rate has only a subtle influence on cancellation, subordinate to other factors."
